* Big O Notation

** Definition

*f(x) = O(g(x))* as *x → ∞* if there exists positive constants *M* and *x₀* such that
*|f(x)| ≤ M × g(x)* for all *x ≥ x₀*. Function *g(x)* typically omits constant factors
and lowest terms.

For example, function *f(n) = 4n² - 2n + 2* grows at an order of *n²* or *f(n) ∈ O(n²)*.

** Orders of Common Functions

| Big-O        | Informal    |
|--------------+-------------|
| O(1)         | constant    |
| O(log n)     | logarithmic |
| O(n)         | linear      |
| O(n × log n) | n × log n   |
| O(n²)        | quadratic   |
| O(n³)        | cubic       |
| O(2ⁿ)        | exponential |
| O(n!)        | factorial   |
