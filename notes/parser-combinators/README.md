# Parser Combinators

> In functional programming, a popular approach to building recursive descent 
> parsers is to model parsers as functions, and to define higher-order functions 
> (or combinators) that implement grammar constructions such as sequencing, 
> choice, and repetition. Such parsers form an instance of a monad, an algebraic
> structure from mathematics that has proved useful for addressing a number of 
> computational problems.
