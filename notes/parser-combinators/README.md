# Parser Combinators

> "In computer programming, a parser combinator is a higher-order function that accepts 
>  several parsers as input and returns a new parser as its output. In this context, a parser 
>  is a function accepting strings as input and returning some structure as output, typically 
>  a parse tree or a set of indices representing locations in the string where parsing stopped 
>  successfully. Parser combinators enable a recursive descent parsing strategy that facilitates 
>  modular piecewise construction and testing. This parsing technique is called combinatory parsing."
