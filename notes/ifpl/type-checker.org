** Notation

#+begin_example
  === value :: TYPE ===

  a :: A

  === tuple ===

  - Coordinates need not be the same type.
  - Tuple type determines dimension and internal types.

  (A₁ ... Aₓ) <- type

  (a₁ ... aₓ) <- value

  === list ===

  - []
  - a:as, where a:A and as::[A]

  [A]         <- type

  [a₁ ... aₓ] <- value, if all successive entries
                 of a finite list are known.

  === structured type ===

  name v₁ ... vₓ ::= c₁ t₁₁ ... t₁ₓ
                   | ...
                   | cₓ tₓ₁ ... tₓₓ

  where name = type-forming operator
        vₓ   = type variable
        cₓ   = constructor
        tₓ   = type expression

  === function ===
  - Function "f" applicable to objects a::A, whose values, (f a),
    are of type B.

  A -> B

  - right associative, binary operation
  A -> B -> C = A -> (B -> C)

** Polymorphism

- monomorphic :: Every value has a single, concrete type:
  ~map :: (num -> num) -> [num] -> [num]~.

- polymorphic :: Every value may be one of many concrete types,
  depending on its context: ~map :: (A -> B) -> [A] -> [B]~.

- ad hoc polymorphism :: A type discipline that permits the same expression
  to denote distinct operations for distinct types. The addition operator
  might denote the addition of both integers, rationals, reals, and complex
  numbers.

- parametric polymorphism :: A type discipline where generic expressions
  are denoted by schematic variables. A polymorphic object may be one
  of many different types, depending on its context.

#+begin_example
  length :: [A] -> num, for all types A
  length []     = 0
  length (x:xs) = (length xs) +  1

  where A = schematic variable

  length :: [num] -> num
  length [7, 11]

  length :: [(char, char)] -> num
  length [('a', 'b'), ('c', 'd')]

  (.) :: (B -> C) -> (A -> B) -> A -> C
  (f . g) x = f (g x)

  where A, B, C = schematic variables

  foldr :: (A -> B -> B) -> B -> [A] -> B
  foldr f b []     = b
  foldr f b (a:as) = f a (foldr f b as)

  where A, B = schematic variables

  foldr :: (num -> num -> num) -> num -> [num] -> num
  foldr + 0 [7, 11, 15]

  foldr :: (string -> string -> string) -> string -> [string] -> string
  foldr append [] ["abc", "def", "ghi"]

** Type Inference

#+begin_quote
  "...[W]e have two type expressions that will usually contain variables,
   the first giving the form of the type required by the context
   (deduced from the 'outside'), and the second giving the form of the type
   which the object can take (deduced from the 'inside'). For the whole
   expression to be well typed, these two type expressions must match,
   in the sense that by substituting for the schematic variables
   of the type expressions, they can be brought to the same form."

** Intermediate Language

A transformed program should be type checked after dependency analysis
but before lambda lifting or transformation into a supercombinator.

#+begin_example
  expression ::= variable
               | λvariable.expression
               | expression expression
               | let variable-1
                     ...
                     variable-x
                 in expression
               | letrec variable-1
                        ...
                        variable-x
                 in <expression>
#+end_example
