# Pratt Parsers

My collection of notes on top-down, operator precedence parsers as implemented by various authors.

> "There are two advantages of separating semantics from syntax in this way.
> First, phrase-structure rules interact more strongly than individual tokens because
> rules can share non-terminals whereas tokens have nothing to share. So our
> assignment of semantics to tokens has a much better chance of being modular
> than an assignment to rules."
