# LISP Interpreters

## Context-Free Grammar
- **derivations**: strings derived from rules of the grammar.
- **productions**: rules that produce strings.
- **head**: name of production.
- **body**: description of what a production generates.
- **terminal**: tokens from the scanner â€” "end points" for the grammar.
- **nonterminal**: a named reference to another rule in the grammar. A few rules containing multiple productions can produce combinatorially larger sets of strings. Recursively-defined rules can produce potentially infinite sets of strings.
- **parser**: maps tokens to terminals in the grammar to figure out which rules could have generated that string.

## Scheme's Core Forms

| definition          | variable definition \| (`begin` definition\*) |
| variable definition | (`define` variable expression) |
| expression          | constant |
