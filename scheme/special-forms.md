# Scheme: Special Forms

> "When a procedure invocation expression is evaluated, the procedure and all 
> the argument expressions must be evaluated before the procedure can be invoked. 
> Special syntactic expressions are special because they are able to manipulate their 
> arguments in an unevaluated form, and can choose whether to evaluate any or all 
> of the argument expressions."
