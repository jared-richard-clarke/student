# Lua and C

Lua is an embedded programming language, implemented and tightly integrated
with the C programming language. Lua is a simple, fast, and deeply-admired language,
built on a clean, ANSI-compliant, and well-documented C codebase. To understand Lua
is to better understand C.

This repository is a collection of notes on and examples of Lua source code.
