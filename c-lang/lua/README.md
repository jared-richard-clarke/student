# Lua and C

Lua is an embedded programming language, implemented and tightly integrated
with the C programming language. Lua is a simple, fast, and deeply-admired language,
built on a clean, ANSI-compliant, and well-documented C codebase. To understand Lua
is to better understand C.

This repository is a collection of notes on and examples of Lua source code.

> "These two views of Lua (as an embeddable language and as an extensible language) correspond to two
> kinds of interaction between C and Lua. In the first kind, C has the control and Lua is the library. The C
> code in this kind of interaction is what we call application code. In the second kind, Lua has the control
> and C is the library. Here, the C code is called library code. Both application code and library code use
> the same API to communicate with Lua, the so-called C API."
