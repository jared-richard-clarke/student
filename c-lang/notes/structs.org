* C ~struct~

~coordinate~ is a variable of type ~struct point~. It is common practice to make a type
synonym so ~struct point~ doesn't need to be typed for every variable declaration.

#+begin_src c
  struct point {
    double x;
    double y;
  } coordinate;

  // === or ===

  typedef struct {
    double x;
    double y;
  } point;

  point coordinate = { 3, 4 };
#+end_src
