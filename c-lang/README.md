# The C Programming Language

I explore the C programming language through code examples and documentation.

The operations on data in the C data model can be divided into three categories:

1. Operations that create or destroy a data object.

2. Operations that access and modify parts of a data object.

3. Operations that combine the values of data objects to form a new value for a data object.
