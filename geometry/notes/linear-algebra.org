** Local and Global Coordinate Systems: 2D

#+begin_example
  === Mapping ===
  
  local    -> global
  (u₁, u₂) -> (x₁, x₂)

  === Aspect Ratio ===

  u₁ - 0 / 1 - 0 = x₁ - min₁ / max₁ - min₁
  u₂ - 0 / 1 - 0 = x₂ - min₂ / max₂ - min₂

  === Interpolation ===
  
  x₁ = (1 - u₁) * min₁ + u₁ * max₁
  x₂ = (1 - u₂) * min₂ + u₂ * max₂

  ======
  
  x₁ = min₁ + u₁ * ∆₁
  x₂ = min₂ + u₂ * ∆₂
  
  where ∆₁ = max₁ - min₁
        ∆₂ = max₂ - min₂

** Points and Vectors: 2D

#+begin_quote
  "The primary reason for differentiating between points and vectors is to achieve
   geometric constructions [that] are /coordinate independent/. Such constructions
   are manipulations applied to geometric objects that produce the same result
   regardless of the location of the coordinate origin."

  — *Practical Linear Algebra*, Gerald Farin and Dianne Hansford

- scalar :: A quantity that has size but no direction.

- point :: A fixed position in space. Has neither size nor shape. Points are equal
  if they have the same coordinates.

- vector :: A quantity that has both size and direction but no fixed position in space.
  Vectors are equal if they have the same length.

#+begin_example
  === 2D point ===
  
  p ∈ 𝔼²
 
  p = ⎡p₁⎤
      ⎣p₂⎦

  === 2D vector ===

  v ∈ ℝ²

  v = q - p
  
  where p ∈ 𝔼²
        q ∈ 𝔼²

  === magnitude ===
  
  |v|² = v₁² + v₂²

  |v| = √(v₁² + v₂²)

  where |v| = vector length

  |kv| = k|v|

  where k = scalar

  === normalization ===

  |w| = 1
  
  w = v / |v|

  where  w  = normalized (unit) vector
        |w| = unit length

*** Coordinate Independent Operations

*s = scalar*, *p, q ∈ 𝔼²* and *v, w ∈ ℝ²*

- Subtracting two points (*p - q*) yields a vector.

- Adding or subtracting two vectors (*v + w* or *v - w*) yields another vector.

- Multiplying a vector by a scalar (*s * v*) yields another vector. Also known
  as scaling.

*** Coordinate Dependent Operations

- Scaling a point (*s * p*) is an ambiguous operation. Scaling by two different coordinate
  systems yields two different points.

- Adding two points (*p + q*) is an ambiguous operation. Adding two points depends on the
  coordinate origin.
