** Local and Global Coordinate Systems: 2D

#+begin_example
  === Mapping ===
  
  local    -> global
  (u₁, u₂) -> (x₁, x₂)

  === Aspect Ratio ===

  (u₁ - 0) / (1 - 0) = (x₁ - min₁) / (max₁ - min₁)
  (u₂ - 0) / (1 - 0) = (x₂ - min₂) / (max₂ - min₂)

  === Interpolation ===
  
  x₁ = (1 - u₁) * min₁ + u₁ * max₁
  x₂ = (1 - u₂) * min₂ + u₂ * max₂

  ======
  
  x₁ = min₁ + u₁ * ∆₁
  x₂ = min₂ + u₂ * ∆₂
  
  where ∆₁ = max₁ - min₁
        ∆₂ = max₂ - min₂

  === local ===

** Points and Vectors: 2D

#+begin_quote
  "The primary reason for differentiating between points and vectors is to achieve
   geometric constructions [that] are /coordinate independent/. Such constructions
   are manipulations applied to geometric objects that produce the same result
   regardless of the location of the coordinate origin."

  — *Practical Linear Algebra*, Gerald Farin and Dianne Hansford

- scalar :: A quantity that has size but no direction.

- point :: A fixed position in space. Has neither size nor shape. Points are equal
  if they have the same coordinates.

- vector :: A quantity that has both size and direction but no fixed position in space.
  Vectors are equal if they have the same length.

#+begin_example
  === 2D point ===
  
  p ∈ 𝔼²
 
  p = ⎡p₁⎤
      ⎣p₂⎦

  === 2D vector ===

  v ∈ ℝ²

  v = q - p
  
  where p ∈ 𝔼²
        q ∈ 𝔼²

  === magnitude ===
  
  |v|² = v₁² + v₂²

  |v| = √(v₁² + v₂²)

  where |v| = vector length

  |kv| = k|v|

  where k = scalar

  === normalization ===

  |w| = 1
  
  w = v / |v|

  where  w  = normalized (unit) vector
        |w| = unit length

  === Barycentric Coordinates ===

  r = p + t * v

  r = p + t * (q - p)

  r = (1 - t) * p + t * q
      ^-----^       ^
         |          |
         +----------+---- Barycentric coordinates

  where r = point
        p = point
        v = vector
        t = |r - p| / |q - p|

  ratio = |r - p| / |q - r|

** Lines

#+begin_example
  === Elements to Define a Line ===
  
  1. Two points.

  2. A point and a vector parallel to a line.

  3. A point and a vector perpendicular to a line.
     A unit vector perpendicular to a line is the
     "normal" of that line.

  === Parametric Equation of a Line ===

  l(t) = p + tv

  l(t) = (1 - t) * p + t * q <- linear interpolation

  where p ∈ 𝔼²
        v ∈ ℝ²
