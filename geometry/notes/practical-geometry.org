** Local and Global Coordinate Systems: 2D

#+begin_example
  === Mapping ===
  
  local    -> global
  (u₁, u₂) -> (x₁, x₂)

  === Aspect Ratio ===

  (u₁ - 0) / (1 - 0) = (x₁ - min₁) / (max₁ - min₁)
  (u₂ - 0) / (1 - 0) = (x₂ - min₂) / (max₂ - min₂)

  === Interpolation ===
  
  x₁ = (1 - u₁)min₁ + u₁max₁
  x₂ = (1 - u₂)min₂ + u₂max₂

  ======
  
  x₁ = min₁ + u₁∆₁
  x₂ = min₂ + u₂∆₂
  
  where ∆₁ = max₁ - min₁
        ∆₂ = max₂ - min₂

  === local ===

  normalized coordinates = (0, 0) to (1, 1)

** Points and Vectors: 2D

#+begin_quote
  "The primary reason for differentiating between points and vectors is to achieve
   geometric constructions [that] are /coordinate independent/. Such constructions
   are manipulations applied to geometric objects that produce the same result
   regardless of the location of the coordinate origin."

  — *Practical Linear Algebra*, Gerald Farin and Dianne Hansford

- scalar :: A quantity that has size but no direction.

- point :: A fixed position in space. Has neither size nor shape. Points are equal
  if they have the same coordinates.

- vector :: A quantity that has both size and direction but no fixed position in space.
  Vectors are equal if they have the same length.

#+begin_example
  === 2D point ===
  
  p ∈ 𝔼²
 
  p = ⎡p₁⎤
      ⎣p₂⎦

  === 2D vector ===

  v ∈ ℝ²

  v = q - p
  
  where p ∈ 𝔼²
        q ∈ 𝔼²

  === magnitude ===
  
  |v|² = v₁² + v₂²

  |v| = √(v₁² + v₂²)

  where |v| = vector length

  |kv| = k|v|

  where k = scalar

  === normalization ===

  |w| = 1
  
  w = v / |v|

  where  w  = normalized (unit) vector
        |w| = unit length

  === Barycentric Coordinates ===

  r = p + tv

  r = p + t(q - p)

  r = (1 - t)p + tq
      ^-----^     ^
         |        |
         +--------+---- Barycentric coordinates

  where r = point
        p = point
        v = vector
        t = |r - p| / |q - p|

  ratio = |r - p| / |q - r|

** Lines

#+begin_quote
  "In geometry, a *straight line*, usually abbreviated *line*, is an infinitely
   long object with no width, depth, or curvature, an idealization of such
   physical objects as a straightedge, a taut string, or a ray of light.
   Lines are spaces of dimension one, which may be embedded in spaces of
   dimension two, three, or higher. The word line may also refer, in everyday
   life, to a line segment, which is a part of a line delimited by two points
   (its endpoints)."

#+begin_example
  === Subset of Euclidean Space ===

  L = { (1 - t)a + tb | t ∈ ℝ }

  === Linear Equation ===

  L = { (x, y) | ax + by = c }
  
  === Elements that Define a Line ===
  
  - Two points.

  - A point and a vector parallel to a line.

  ●

  - A point and a vector perpendicular to a line.
    A unit vector perpendicular to a line is the
    "normal" of that line.

  === Parametric Equation of a Line ===

  l(t) = p + tv

  l(t) = (1 - t)p + tq <- linear interpolation

  where p ∈ 𝔼²
        q ∈ 𝔼²
        v ∈ ℝ²

  === Implicit Equation of a Line ===

  ax₁ + bx₂ + c = 0

  where a = a₁
        b = a₂
        c = -a₁p₁ - a₂p₂

  === Explicit Equation of a Line ===

  x₂ = -(a / b)x₁ - (c / b)

  x₂ = âx₁ + b̂

  where â = slope
        b̂ = e₂ intercept (0, b̂)
