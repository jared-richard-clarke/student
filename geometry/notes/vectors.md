# Vectors

> "The process of abstraction is a powerful one...Take whole numbers, for instance. 
> Like vectors, they are abstractions. We could say that whole numbers are what is 
> left of the idea of apples when we ignore not only the apple trees, the wind and 
> the rain, the profits of cider makers, and other such items that would appear in 
> an encyclopedia article, but also ignore even the apples themselves, and 
> concentrate solely on how many there are. After we have extracted from the idea 
> of apples the idea of whole numbers, we find that whole numbers apply to all sorts 
> of situations that have nothing to do with apples. Much the same is true of vectors.
