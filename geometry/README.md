> Geometry(noun): the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, solids, and higher dimensional analogs.

Here I implement a growing collection of geometric functions. My goal is to better understand the 
similarities and differences between programming languages by implementing similar programs.
