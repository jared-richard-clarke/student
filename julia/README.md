# Julia: Programming Language

A growing collection of `Julia` programs and notes that I use to improve my learning.

## A Note on `constructors.jl`

> "It only makes sense to take ratios of integer values, so the parameter type `T` is 
> restricted to being a subtype of `Integer`, and a ratio of integers represents a value 
> on the real number line, so any `Rational` is an instance of the `Real` abstraction."
