# The Mechanics of Append
This folder contains a copy of the `Append` function as defined by Rob Pike in his Go blog [Arrays, slices (and strings): The mechanics of 'append'](https://go.dev/blog/slices). 
Append mirrors Go's built-in `append` function. Built-in `append` is a generic operation, whereas example `Append` accepts only `int` slices.
